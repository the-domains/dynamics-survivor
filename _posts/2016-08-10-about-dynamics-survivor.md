# About Dynamics Survivor

This site is a collection of links and content related to the technologies around [Microsoft Dynamics 365][0]. These may include:

Dynamics CRM

Dynamics AX

Dynamics NAV

Power BI

PowerApps

Flow

Microsoft AppSource

Azure

Office 365

Yes, that's quite a long list of MSFT technologies. It is precisely the reason why keeping track of what is happening in this cloud business applications space can feel overwhelming - and why we should try and do something about it!

Dynamics Survivor is maintained by [Jukka Niiranen][1], a Microsoft Business Solutions MVP with a 10+ year experience of specializing in Microsoft Dynamics CRM. [The Surviving CRM blog][2] is still the primary destination for my original content around the Dynamics CRM platform, but this site serves as an outlet for me to share the news articles, blog posts and helpful tidbits that I come across when learning about the broader scope of Dynamics 365\.

The Dynamics Survivor site is an experiment built with [The Grid][3] - an "AI website that builds itself". It's still all in beta and the features of the service will probably break, change and irritate both the site owner as well as the readers at times. Which, to be honest, is something I expect to also encounter with the evolving Dynamics 365 technologies during the early days. That's why it sounds to me like these two would be such a good match: learning something about new ways of content management while exploring the next chapter of cloud business apps.
